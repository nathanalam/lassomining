    "- In this version each time MAST needs to be run on a putative maturation enzyme in a particular genome, a lookup in the database is performed to check if this protein has been analyzed by MAST before and if it has then use the values from before\n",
    "- In this version traseq will be used instead of getorf for finding precursors\n",
    "- getorf is still used for finding neighbors\n",
    "- Like v4 except that multiple proteins of the same sequence don't cause wrong locations of maturation enzymes to be reported\n",
    "- Another change is that the pattern needs to be adjusted to [MVL] instead of ^ in the beginning\n",
    "- This version fixes the problem of having a useless %AME hash and also of erasing sequences from %AME_scores\n",
    "- Precursor pattern is output into the log file\n",
    "- ORF searching behavior is changed from stop-to-stop to [MVL]-to-stop\n",
    "- Clusters of precursors are saved in clusters.txt\n",
    "- **Warning**: transeq doesn't label the -1, -2, -3 frames sequentially. Sometimes it is -1, -3, -2, sometimes some other combination. This means the precursor locations on the reverse strand are off by one sometimes\n",
    "- Take note that rank_hits expects 4 motifs for the B enzyme and 3 motifs for the C enzyme. Adjust accordingly."
